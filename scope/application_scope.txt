Functions required to have fully operating application.

START APPLICATION:
- Start off with a small window that has:
  - New game
    - ask round robin or division
    - display list of players / ability to add or remove
    - this will allow you to add all the players (or read from a players.db file)
    - when you build the team list, be sure to provide a method of changing which team they are on
    - store all data in a sqlite3 database
  - Open game
    - if application crashes, allow the feature to reopen the databse so we dont lose anything
  - Quit


NEW GAME:
- After you click NEW GAME - the following option menus appear:
  - provide a list to be able to add/remove/or modify name
  - randomize the teams or allow manual pairing of teammates
  - dont forget to assign based off round robin or split divisions (provide option to choose which way to run)
  - assign a team # to each player
    - if its two divisions, split into A and B
    - if its round robin, doesn't need to be labeled with A or B

- After teams have been entered, and randomized or assigned manually;
  - Generate all games based off of round robin or division
    - if round robin, then everyone needs to play everyone else
    - if divisions, then everyone will play each other once in their own division
    - generate score cards + provide option to print to a printer (if enough time)

- PLAY BEGINS
  - begin playing horseshoes (nothing happens in the application, unless we want to track start and end times for
    historical purposes.. probably a good feature to have to gain an average of how long a game takes)

- WHEN A GAME FINISHES:
  - provide an option in the unique identifier for the game
    - who won
    - who lost
    - final score
  - provide a separate table for ringers
    - how many ringers each person had and which game number
    - automatically sort list by highest ringers

- PAYOUTS
  - provide just a single box for how much it costs to enter the game ($20 ea person)
  - provide just a single box for how much each ringers are ($10 ea person)
  - provide an option to break it down for top two teams in the championship
    - the option to break it down will include a percentage (80% to winner, 20% to losers for example)
      - this can be modified
  - do same thing for ringer payout
    - allow for how many players can get paid out (1,2 or 3)
    - allow the percentages to be changed for each place
      - example: 2 players - 85% to 1st, 15% second
      - example: 3 players - 70% 1st, 20% second, 10% third (allow to be changed)
  - display payouts on a section or data point on the screen

- DISPLAY
- Standings will be displayed based off round robin or division games
     -> need to have two tournament displays for rankings if there is  divisions A and division B

- PLAYOFFS
  - playoffs will be on the next screen (change the layout)
  - need to find out how to determine how many teams get into the playoffs
    - i suppose we could just allow the option to enter in how many teams to play
    - provide the option
